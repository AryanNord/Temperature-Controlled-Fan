# Temperature-Controlled-Fan
Here In the first step the sensor senses the temperature by temperature and humidity sensor namely DHT11. In the second step, the sensor's output is taken and conversion of temperature value into a suitable number in Celsius scale is done. The fan speed is controlled by using PWM signals.
